# RestaurantContactInfoScraper (the Factual scraper)

Scrapes Factual. Built by Joshua King.

## How to use it (as best I can tell)

1. Run `mvn clean package` in this directory
2. Copy the jarfile that doesn't say "original" in the `target/` folder that gets created.
3. Run `java -jar <that-jar-file>`
4. Use the menus to navigate it.
5. Use this Factual information:
    ```    
    KEY    : WynD7vY8DuZXFSsQng6ePIsaT3pPUgDx5TwZV41f
    SECRET : tqP4PIK5oKIpRF5mRxRJJI1IDrUp8gXI4fKIPUjl
     ````
